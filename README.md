# Interview-26th-July

Produces a 2x2 set of graphs. Top left is Setosa, top right is Versicolour, and bottom left is Vriginica.
X axis is sepal width, Y axis is sepal length. Size is petal length and colour is petal width.
The bottom right graph shows what size and colour correspond to in length and width.

Didn't have time to put in axes or draw any particular trends.
